# TCV Blockchain Dashboard
By: Christopher Pondoc

## Motivation
In the short-term, we're moving into a multi-chain ecosystem. Numerous L1s will spring up trying to be the ETH killer, while L2s will help lead the charge on scaling Ethereum for the next decade. Rather than trying to get too involved in the nitty gritty, we think that it's best instead to monitor overall activity, use cases, and developer engagement.

## Properties
The current dashboard indexes the following chains:
* Polygon
* Avalanche C-Chain
* BNB Chain (Binance Smart Chain)

For each of the chains above, the following metrics are provided:
* Developer Metrics (# of contributors, stars, commits, etc. according to the Electric Capital taxonomy.)
* All Open-Source Repositories
* Total Value Locked
* Daily Number of Active Addresses
* Daily Number of Transactions
